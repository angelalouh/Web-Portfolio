# Web-Portfolio
To round out my HTML & CSS fundamentals module at Thinkful, I have created my first public web project! 
This assignment challenged me to build a simple one-page website using the fundamental HTML and CSS skills I have learned.
In my portfolio you will find introductory information about myself, my interests, and a few ways to reach me.
