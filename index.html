          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              In college, my goal was to go into the healthcare industry, and after graduating from Boston University, I worked as a medical scribe for many years. While working as a medical scribe, I, unfortunately, realized a career in medicine was not for me, but I simultaneously started developing an interest in software development. Thanks to the support and encouragement of my friends and family, I decided to take the leap and pursue a career change.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am now a student in the Software Engineering Flex Program at Thinkful and the more I learn about software development, the more I am enjoying it. Not only is the work fun and challenging, but it is also rewarding to see my code run without issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I continue my studies at Thinkful, I would love the opportunity to work with others. If anyone is looking to collaborate on a project together, please <a href="#contact"> reach out</a>!
